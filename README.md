# 📂 Nilay Verma's Assignments (23110219)
## Course: MSE:203 Introduction to Computational Materials

### 📜 About This Repository
This repository contains assignments for the course MSE:203. The folders include all essential files required for the assignment reports—except for simulation-generated files, which you can create yourself! 🛠️

### 🚀 Running the Simulations
Wanna see some atoms dance? 🕺💃 Follow these simple steps:

### 🔧 Requirements
1. 🏗️ LAMMPS – to run the simulation files.
2. 🔬 OVITO – to visualize and analyze the results.

### 🏃‍♂️ Steps to Run
1️⃣ Open your terminal and run:
```
lmp -in input_file.in
```
*(Replace input_file.in with the actual input filename. Make sure you are in the directory that contains input_file.in, or provide the full path as path/to/input_file.in.)*

2️⃣ LAMMPS will generate output files, including a `dump file` containing simulation data.

3️⃣ Load the `dump file` in **OVITO** to visualize the simulation and...
sip a tea ☕ while atoms do their magic! 🧪✨

🎯 Happy Simulating! 💡
