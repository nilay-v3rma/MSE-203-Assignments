📜 About This Repository
This repository contains assignments for the course MSE:203. The folders include all essential files required for the assignment reports—except for simulation-generated files, which you can create yourself! 🛠️

🚀 Running the Simulations
Wanna see some atoms dance? 🕺💃 Follow these simple steps:

🔧 Requirements
🏗️ LAMMPS – to run the simulation files.
🔬 OVITO – to visualize and analyze the results.
🏃‍♂️ Steps to Run
1️⃣ Open your terminal and run:
```
lmp -in input_file.in
```
(Replace <input_file.in> with the actual input filename.)

2️⃣ This will generate a dump file.

3️⃣ Load the dump file in OVITO to visualize the simulation and...
☕ sip a tea while atoms do their magic! 🧪✨

🎯 Happy Simulating! 💡
